## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The user of our application must be able to register, login/logout, access their client area and process their rentals. 
<br> 
All this, visually from the browser.
<br>
![Login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109986640/205515842-04a0404a-8b70-4503-8bd7-431f340bb140.png)
The user can also do a search in our database, either for movies or series, by their title.
<br>
In addition to being able to rent and return movies, the user will be able to access all the information about their ongoing rental.
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To start, we will clone the repository (https://github.com/hectorgv00/proyecto5-FrontEnd-Videoclub) from GitHub,
with the gitbash console or in VSC.

## Installing

Once cloned, we will install all the dependencies of our project with command in console:

```
npm i
```

This will create a folder called "node_modules" which will contain everything necessary to make our application work.

## Initializing

The package.json contains a script called "start" which we will call to launch our react project.

```
npm run start
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

We can perform all the functions mentioned above: register, login/logout, search for movies or series, rent movies or series and access our user area.

As administrators, we will also be able to remove users from our database and see all active rentals.
